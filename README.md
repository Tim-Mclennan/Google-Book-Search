# Hi, I'm Tim! ðŸ‘‹


## ðŸš€ About Me
I'm a fullstack software engineer with a focus on the frontend. 

I love solving problems and continuously teaching myself new concepts. I have years of professional experience and seeking to develop myself in a technical team. 


# Google Book Search

The objective of creating this Google Book Search is to showcase some of the frontend skills I have learnt while attending Nology's software engineering program. 

The languages and techniques I have used in this project include:
- HTML
- CSS 
- SCSS
- Javascript (DOM, Fetch API, Async functions)


## Features

- Search feature that allows end users to find a book using the search feature.
- Utilises Fetch to display data from Google Books API.
- Displays a modal when user clicks on Book.
- Modular design, segregation of JS functions (Allows for easier reading, customising and Unit Testing).
- Minimalist colour palette.


## Lessons Learned

- **What did you learn while building this project?**

The main skills I developed from this project were predominantly focused on Document Object Maniuplation and getting my hands dirty with an Application Programming Interface. 



Another lesson I learnt from this project was how Asynchronous functions work.


- **What challenges did you face and how did you overcome them?**

One of the major challenges I faced was iterating through and displaying multiple API data points to the HTML doc.
